            <p class="class_principal_parrafo2">
                From a young age, my passion for technology has been evident. I recently participated in AWS re/Start, where I developed skills as a Cloud Practitioner and completed a Python course to strengthen my programming and automation skills. 
                I stand out for my ability to work in a team and my belief in collaboration as the key to success, as well as my agility to adapt to upcoming changes. 
                My goal is to work in a prominent company where I can apply my knowledge and achieve my professional goals. I am committed to continuous learning and excited about the opportunities the tech field offers for continued growth.
